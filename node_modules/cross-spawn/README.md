A cross platform solution to node's spawn and spawnSync.

## Installation

Node.js version 8 and up:
`$ npm install cross-spawn`

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you are using `spawnSync` on node 0.10 or older, you will also need to install `spawn-sync`:

`$ npm install spawn-sync`

=======
Node.js version 7 and under:
`$ npm install cross-spawn@6`
>>>>>>> df43f6dae2417a40e6f3be5b5a8c6bb325d1f989

## Why

Node has issues when using spawn on Windows:

- It ignores [PATHEXT](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2318)
- It does not support [shebangs](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang)
- No `options.shell` support on node < v6
- It does not allow you to run `del` or `dir`

All these issues are handled correctly by `cross-spawn`.
There are some known modules, such as [win-spawn](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/win-spawn), that try to solve this but they are either broken or provide faulty escaping of shell arguments.


## Usage

Exactly the same way as node's [`spawn`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) or [`spawnSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options), so it's a drop in replacement.


```js
var spawn = require('cross-spawn');

// Spawn NPM asynchronously
var child = spawn('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], { stdio: 'inherit' });

// Spawn NPM synchronously
var results = spawn.sync('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], { stdio: 'inherit' });
```


## Caveats

#### `options.shell` as an alternative to `cross-spawn`

Starting from node v6, `spawn` has a `shell` option that allows you run commands from within a shell. This new option solves most of the problems that `cross-spawn` attempts to solve, but:

- It's not supported in node < v6
- It has no support for shebangs on Windows
- You must manually escape the command and arguments which is very error prone, specially when passing user input

If you are using the `shell` option to spawn a command in a cross platform way, consider using `cross-spawn` instead. You have been warned.


#### Shebangs

While `cross-spawn` handles shebangs on Windows, its support is limited: e.g.: it doesn't handle arguments after the path, e.g.: `#!/bin/bash -e`.

Remember to always test your code on Windows!
